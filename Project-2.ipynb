    "4. The report should be no more than 20 pages, including one page describing the contributions of each of the members in the group, figures, tables and codes. \n",

The dataset for this study was generated from a large number of FEM analyses for a real research project, and it is given also in the file folder. The Python code for the neural network is given there as Neural_network_FEA.py. Note that this neural network model is for predicting the entire time history of the velocity of the bullet, before and after the penetration. Before doing your tasks before, you should try to repeat the work on NN first using exactly the same dataset and codes.  \n",

Note that for the penetrated cases, the residual velocity will still be positive. For the not-penetrated cases, it is negative because the bullet is bounced back. \n",
